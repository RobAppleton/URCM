# Unified Recursive Cosmological Model (URCM)

Welcome to the **Unified Recursive Cosmological Model (URCM)** repository — a symbolic, operator-driven framework for cosmology built on recursive evolution, information conservation, and entropy logic. This project spans a full theoretical model, empirical simulations, operator algebra, and open-source tools for further development and testing.

---

##  Overview

URCM proposes a recursive, operator-based alternative to inflationary and singular cosmologies. It introduces symbolic operators — Compression (Ĉ), Entropy Reset (Ŝ), and Bounce (𝐵̂) — to model the universe's evolution across cycles, preserving information while regulating entropy via simulation logic.

The project includes:

- Core Books outlining the model (Books 1–9)
- A formal preprint
- Expansion volumes for advanced topics (e.g., entropy traps, post-selection)
- A Python-based simulation engine
- Contributor documentation and feedback systems

##  Simulation Engine

Python 3.10+ scripts live in the `Python/` folder. They include:

- Recursion engine (`urcm_core.py`)
- Operator definitions (`init_operator_set.py`)
- Metric calculators and entropy diagnostics
- Test routines for empirical matching against Planck, BICEP2, and LiteBIRD datasets

For fast validation or exploratory runs, you may also unzip and use the contents of `URCM Scripts.zip`.

##  Contributing

Contributions are encouraged across theory, coding, simulation, and documentation.

Ways to contribute:
- Propose new symbolic operators
- Challenge or validate recursion metrics
- Add diagrams or glossary entries
- Improve simulation tooling or notebooks

See [`Contributing.md`](./Contributing.md) for the full guide.
