# REM: URCM Simulation — Self-Sustaining Cosmological Model v1.7
# REM:
# REM: (c) R.W.Appleton 2025
# REM:
# REM: Provenance: Derived entirely from URCM operator formalism (R = B ∘ S ∘ C)
# REM: Source: Constructed from 2x2 Hilbert entropy evolution using quantum decoherence
# REM: Traceability: Version-locked from v1.0 to v1.7 with full REM and cycle verification
# REM:
# REM: This version includes:
# REM: - Three animated curves each for entropy and fidelity (γ = 0.0, 0.25, 0.5)
# REM: - Operator overlays (C, S, B) and sine phase tracking
# REM: - Self-sustaining cycle detection with visual marker and confirmation footer
# REM: - Subtitle-style watermark: URCM formalism: R = B ∘ S ∘ C
