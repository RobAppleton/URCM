# REM: URCM Simulation â€” Entropy and Scale Factor Evolution with Noise Level Overlay (Final)
# REM:
# REM: This simulation has been created solely using URCM Python simulations, derived from
# REM: first principles. These include recursive entropy compression and scale factor modeling
# REM: based on theoretical formulations involving r = a(t), von Neumann entropy dynamics,
# REM: and decoherence operators within a 2D Hilbert space.
# REM:
# REM: This simulation begins at t = 0.5 (mid-bounce) and spans to t = 2.5, completing two full
# REM: URCM cycles. It models entropy and scale factor evolution as the universe moves between
# REM: singularity resets. Bounce events are signaled when entropy collapses below threshold.
# REM:
# REM: NEW IN THIS VERSION:
# REM: - Includes horizontal lines marking key noise levels (0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75)
# REM: - Marks the maximum noise level reached during simulation
# REM: - Overlays entropy, scale factor, and operator activation curves
