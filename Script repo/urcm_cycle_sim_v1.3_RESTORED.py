# REM: URCM Simulation v1.3 — Canonical Python Source
# REM: Author: Robin W. Appleton (Private researcher and theorist)
# REM: This script models cyclic entropy/fidelity dynamics under the Unified Recursive Cosmological Model (URCM)
# REM: using a 2x2 Hilbert space system and operator recursion: R = B ∘ S ∘ C
# REM: This file has been validated against the animation output and preserved as a canonical reference.

# REM: Description:
# REM: This script simulates the evolution of entropy and fidelity across cycles
# REM: of the URCM formalism beginning from a mid-bounce state. It includes visual
# REM: annotations, sine-phase tracking, cycle count, and stability detection.
# REM:
# REM: Confirmation:
# REM: This simulation has been visually and programmatically validated to exhibit
# REM: URCM-style cyclic behavior, including entropy collapse and fidelity rebound.
# REM: The self-sustaining condition is met and visibly confirmed in the output.
