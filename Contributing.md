# Contributing to URCM

I appreciate your interest in contributing to the **Unified Recursive Cosmological Model (URCM)** project. Whether you're here to submit code, 
propose a symbolic operator, raise a theoretical challenge, or improve the documentation, we’re glad to have you.

This guide outlines the process for contributing and the standards we follow.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repository**  
   Use GitHub’s fork button to create your own copy of the project.

2. **Clone Your Fork**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/urcm.git
   ```

3. **Create a Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. **Make Your Changes**

5. **Commit with a Clear Message**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add: New symbolic operator for recursive transition"
   ```

6. **Push and Open a Pull Request**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
   Then, go to the original repo and open a PR with a clear summary.

## Code Standards

- Use clear, descriptive function and variable names.
- Include inline comments where reasoning or recursion logic may not be obvious.
- Python 3.10+ is preferred. Format code using `black` or `ruff`.
- Include at least one test if adding simulation logic.

---

## Symbolic Operators and Theory Contributions

We welcome proposals for:

- New **operator sequences** (with rationale)
- Revisions to **existing recursion grammars**
- Empirical challenges or **testable predictions**

Please submit these in Markdown format under `/operators/proposals/` or via the Issues tab.

---

## Documentation

We value clarity. If you notice something that could be better explained:

- Submit a pull request editing the relevant `.md` files.
- Add new visual aids or operator diagrams to `/docs/figures`.
- Typos and grammar fixes are always welcome.

---

## Issues and Feature Requests

If you encounter bugs, unexpected behaviour, or want to request a new feature:

- Use the **Issues** tab.
- Please be as specific as possible—logs, screenshots, or test cases help.
- Tag your issue appropriately: `bug`, `enhancement`, `operator`, `question`, etc.

## Code of Conduct

This project is a space for rigorous, respectful discourse.  
We ask that you:

- Be constructive in feedback.
- Challenge ideas, not people.
- Credit contributors fairly.

See [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for full details.

## Acknowledgement

This is a model-in-progress, open to iteration, challenge, and even collapse under data. 
Contributions of all kinds are welcomed—especially those that improve falsifiability or simulate edge cases.
